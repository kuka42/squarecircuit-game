# Square Circuit

Square Circuit is a racing game for 1-4 players, where each player controls a vehicle represented by a square and races around a circular track. The game includes a collision system with other players as well as the track boundaries. The vehicles leave trails behind them, and the game accounts for acceleration and drifting mechanics. Each player is equipped with their own lap counter and a specific keyboard layout to steer their square. Players can push each other off the track!
